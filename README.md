<h1>PacMan Project</h1>
<p>
This is a learning project and homage to classic arcade game, PacMan. I am using this as a learning activity to better understand how to allow users to manipulate images or animations using JavaScript and HTML5/CSS. The files can be loaded into a web browser.
</p>
<br>

<h6>Features:</h6>
<p>Arrow key movements allowing the user to manipulate the movement of the PacMan animation. PacMan can eat fruits by running over them from the left or right, and scoreboard is increased each time a fruit is eaten.</p>
<br>

<h6>Usage:</h6> 
<p>Users can move the image up and down using the arrow (up or down) keys, or w (for up) and s (for down) copying the popular wasd movement rules that are used in many PC games.
</p>
<br>

<h6>Future features should include: </h6>
<ul>
<li>pellet/food items animations that PacMan can be moved to "eat"--Implemented 3/31/21</li>
<li>sound effects based on movement, eating, and other key events</li>
<li>a points system that is shown on the screen--Implemented 4/4/21</li>
<li>random walk ghost animations that would cause player to lose points if they reach PacMan</li>
<li>a maze system to create additional movement complexity/complication</li>
</ul>
