<h1>PacMan Project</h1>
<p>
This is a learning project and homage to classic arcade game, PacMan. I am using this as a learning activity to better understand how to allow users to manipulate images or animations using JavaScript and HTML5/CSS. The files can be loaded into a web browser.
</p>
<br>

<h6>Features:</h6>
<p>Arrow key movements allowing the user to manipulate the movement of the PacMan animation. </p>
<br>

<h6>Usage:</h6> 
<p>Users can move the image up and down using the arrow (up or down) keys, or w (for up) and s (for down) copying the popular wasd movement rules that are used in many PC games.
</p>
<br>

<h6>Future features should include: </h6>
<ul>
<li>pellet/food items animations that PacMan can be moved to "eat"</li>
<li>sound effects based on movement, eating, and other key events</li>
<li>a points system that is shown on the screen</li>
<li>random walk ghost animations that would cause player to lose points if they reach PacMan</li>
<li>a maze system to create additional movement complexity/complication</li>
</ul>
